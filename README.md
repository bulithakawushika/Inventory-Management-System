# Inventory Management System

This is an Inventory Management System developed using Spring Boot for the backend, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and SQL for the database. The project utilizes Thymeleaf as the template engine for server-side rendering, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on inventory items.
- **API Endpoints**: Expose APIs for integrating with other systems or applications.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly frontend interface designed using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for creating RESTful APIs and managing dependencies.
- **Thymeleaf**: Server-side Java template engine for rendering HTML templates.
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and access control for securing endpoints.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **HTML and CSS**: Frontend technologies for building the user interface.
- **SQL**: Database language for managing data persistence.
